Contract-driven Incident IQ Python SDK (distribution: `incident-py-q`, import: `incident_py_q`).

Coverage and phase-status badges are published by CI to a dedicated `badges` branch so protected branches (`main`, `staging`, `dev`) never require bot commits for badge refreshes.

The package ships:
- sync and async clients (`Client`, `AsyncClient`)
- strict runtime response validation against bundled Incident IQ contracts
- dynamic SDK namespaces generated from schema operations
- schema sync tooling for the published Incident IQ OpenAPI contract
- contract/unit/integration tests, docs site tooling, and CI workflows

## Requirements

- Python `3.14+`

## Install

```bash
python -m pip install incident-py-q
```

Development install:

```bash
python -m pip install -e '.[dev]'
```

## Authentication and Tenant URL

Default auth mode is bearer token:

```text
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

Each client requires a tenant-specific base URL. You may pass either the tenant root
(`https://your-tenant.incidentiq.com`) or an explicit API prefix such as
`https://your-tenant.incidentiq.com/api/v1.0`. Bare tenant roots are normalized to
`/api/v1.0`. Golden contract paths are tenant-absolute (`/api/v1.0/...`), and Silver
routes that include an absolute tenant path such as `/api/v1.0/...`, `/services/...`,
`/apps/...`, or `/pub/...` are sent from the tenant origin so they do not accidentally
inherit the base URL prefix twice.

Runtime environment variables:
- `INCIDENTIQ_BASE_URL` (required unless passed explicitly)
- `INCIDENTIQ_API_TOKEN` (required unless passed explicitly)
- `INCIDENTIQ_SITE_ID` (optional)
- `INCIDENTIQ_CLIENT_HEADER` (optional, default `ApiClient`)
- `INCIDENTIQ_AUTH_MODE` (optional, default `bearer`, supported: `bearer`, `raw`)
- `INCIDENTIQ_APP_HEADERS_JSON` (optional JSON object string for app-path calls)

Security hardening rules:
- `INCIDENTIQ_BASE_URL` must use `https`
- base URLs with embedded credentials, query strings, or fragments are rejected
- `client_header` and `site_id` values cannot contain CR/LF characters
- timeout and retry tuning values must stay within safe positive/non-negative bounds

Integration/smoke environment variables:
- `INCIDENTIQ_TEST_BASE_URL` (required for integration tests)
- `INCIDENTIQ_TEST_API_TOKEN` (required for integration tests)
- `INCIDENTIQ_TEST_SITE_ID` (optional)
- `INCIDENTIQ_TEST_CLIENT_HEADER` (optional, default `ApiClient`)
- `INCIDENTIQ_TEST_AUTH_MODE` (optional, default `bearer`)
- `INCIDENTIQ_TEST_APP_HEADERS_JSON` (optional JSON object string for app-path integration calls)
- optional app lookup smoke identifiers for Intune, Mosyle, and Google Device Data

## SDK-First Quick Start

```python
from incident_py_q import Client

client = Client(
    base_url="https://your-tenant.incidentiq.com",
    api_token="your-token",
)

users = client.users.get_users_legacy()
users_raw = client.users.get_users_legacy.raw()
```

Async:

```python
import asyncio
from incident_py_q import AsyncClient

async def main() -> None:
    async with AsyncClient(
        base_url="https://your-tenant.incidentiq.com",
        api_token="your-token",
    ) as client:
        payload = await client.users.get_users_legacy.raw()
        print(type(payload))

asyncio.run(main())
```

Low-level request API:

```python
payload = client.request(
    "GET",
    "/users/{UserId}",
    path_params={"UserId": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"},
)
```

Undocumented app-path APIs:

```python
apps = client.apps.registry.list_apps()
intune_lookup = client.apps.microsoft_intune.lookup_asset(
    asset_id="asset-guid",
    serial_number="SER123",
)
google_actions = client.apps.google_device_data.list_remote_actions()
```

Current-user assigned/open ticket queue:

```python
from incident_py_q import Client

with Client.from_env() as client:
    tickets = client.silver.tickets.list_current_user_assigned_tickets(
        page_size=100,
        sort_by="TicketModifiedDate",
        sort_direction="Descending",
    )
    agent_tickets = client.silver.tickets.list_assigned_tickets_for_agent(
        agent_user_id="00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
        schema="Open",
        page_size=100,
    )
    statuses = client.tickets.get_ticket_statuses.raw()
    print(tickets, agent_tickets, statuses)
```

`list_current_user_assigned_tickets(...)` is a read-only Silver helper around the
UI-observed `POST /services/tickets/-/-/AssignedToMe_Unassigned` queue. That
queue can include both current-user assigned rows and unassigned rows, and some
tenants resolve the assigned-to-me portion differently between ticket queue rows
and dashboard count summaries. Use
`client.silver.analytics.get_agent_current_stats(...)` when you need the
tenant's authoritative assigned-to-me and unassigned counts, and use this helper
when you need the queue rows. See `examples/current_user_assigned_tickets.py` for
a report that also fetches recent ticket actions and comments.

For service-account automation, use
`client.silver.tickets.list_assigned_tickets_for_agent(...)` instead. It queries
`POST /services/tickets` with `Schema` set to `Open` or `All` and
`Filters=[{"Facet": "agent", "Id": agent_user_id}]`, so the target agent is
explicit and does not depend on the authenticated SDK user's current session.
Live validation for issue #87 showed `schema="Open"` matched the expected open
ticket UI count. `schema="All"` returned the API's broader all-schema result,
which was one row higher than the stated UI/history total, so treat `All` as API
history rather than an exact UI badge count until Incident IQ publishes the UI
exclusion rule.

## Validation Strategy

- Runtime uses bundled schemas only, never network fetches during requests.
- Success JSON responses are validated against operation response schema.
- Schema violations raise `ValueError` (`SchemaValidationError` subtype).
- App-path calls under `client.apps.*` are validated against bundled HAR-derived schemas.

## Development Commands

```bash
python scripts/run_local_ci.py --target dev
python scripts/run_local_ci.py --target staging
python scripts/run_local_ci.py --target main
```

Branch targets map directly to the GitHub Actions gates:
- `dev`: audit, Ruff, mypy, non-integration tests with coverage, and wheel build
- `staging`: everything in `dev`, plus live integration tests
- `main`: everything in `staging`, plus docs generation

## Schema Sync

Refresh bundled contracts from official upstream sources:

```bash
python scripts/sync_schemas.py
python scripts/update_sdk_inventory.py
python scripts/reconcile_silver_inventory.py
python scripts/extract_har_app_inventory.py <intune.har> <mosyle.har> <google.har>
```

`sync_schemas.py` pulls the published OpenAPI contract, `update_sdk_inventory.py`
regenerates the Golden/Silver/merged inventory snapshots, and
`reconcile_silver_inventory.py` drops bundled Silver routes the contract now
documents. Golden always wins a route-level conflict with Silver.

Bundled source tree:
- `src/incident_py_q/data/openapi/openapi-spec.json` (Golden contract, primary)
- `src/incident_py_q/data/openapi/metadata.json` (sync provenance)
- `src/incident_py_q/data/source_manifest.json` (source manifest)
- `src/incident_py_q/data/silver_inventory.json` (Silver inventory: HAR-derived + migrated routes)
- `src/incident_py_q/data/legacy/contract.json` (schemas for routes migrated off Golden)
- `src/incident_py_q/data/legacy/aliases.json` (deprecated method-name aliases)
- `src/incident_py_q/data/app_schemas.json` (HAR-derived app-path schemas)

## Upgrading from the pre-OpenAPI SDK

The Golden contract moved to the published OpenAPI document, which renamed most operations
and stopped documenting 64 routes. Those routes moved to `client.silver.*` rather than being
dropped, and every previous method name still works as a deprecated alias that forwards to its
new location and emits a `DeprecationWarning`.

One legacy name could not be preserved: `client.tickets.assign_ticket` now reaches a different
operation than it used to. `incident_py_q.legacy_alias_conflicts()` reports it at runtime.

See [docs/migration-openapi.md](docs/migration-openapi.md) for the full mapping. To find every
call site that needs updating:

```python
import warnings

warnings.simplefilter("error", DeprecationWarning)
```

Regenerate the compatibility bundle from the pre-migration commit with:

```bash
python scripts/build_legacy_compat.py --from-ref <commit>
```

## Versioning and Stability

- The package follows semantic versioning.
- `incident_py_q.__version__` matches package metadata version.
- Generated SDK surface is semver-significant and protected by golden tests.
- Promotion into `main` requires exactly one release label: `semver:patch`, `semver:minor`, or `semver:major`.
- Promotion workflows propagate the source PR's semver label when one is present and otherwise default the promotion PR to `semver:patch`.

## Documentation

Project docs are built with MkDocs Material and pdoc:

```bash
python scripts/build_docs.py
```
